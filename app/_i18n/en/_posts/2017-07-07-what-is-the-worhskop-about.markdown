It is becoming clear that services able to efficiently synchronise, share and process the growing data volumes across different Cloud infrastructures will become the keystone of modern research.

Applications from user communities requiring large-scale data synchronization and sharing are already challenging existingIT infrastructures in all areas, from security models through scalability and performance to ease of use. This situation calls for renewing computing and data management infrastructures and the way research is done locally and across collaborating institutes.

We will meet at the 3rd Cloud Services for Synchronisation and Sharing (CS3) Conference to review the state-of-the-art and share experiences about cloud storage services.

The community which gathered around the previous CS3 events includes users, service providers and developers of technological solutions.  As in the past, the conference will maximise the opportunity to liaise with key actors of the community.

In the previous CS3 conferences we witnessed the grow in complexity of Cloud Storage installations along the maturing of related  technologies.  Key actors in the Cloud Storage met at CS3 bridging between the evolution of technologies (and the need to standardise and interoperate) with new ideas from user communities exposing their experience and needs.

Three facts became clear during last conference at the ETH in Zurich:

* Existence of a vital community convinced of the potential of Cloud Storage technologies
* Demonstration of Cloud Storage as new platform for scientific and technical research
* Need of a Cloud Storage federation to enable collaborative research across different institutes and infrastructures

A hallmark of CS3 has always been to invite companies and development teams to share their experience and plans: they are invited to submit abstracts about their strategy and their technologies to be openly discussed.

We have seen that this is important to share the experience, ideas and plans from groups providing Cloud services and users comparing and proposing new ways to use these services.

We invite you to submit abstracts using the abstract submission page. Selected presentations (oral or poster) will be part of a Book of Abstracts to be published in the conference website (the Book of Abstracts of last conference is available [online](https://cs3.ethz.ch/CS3-ETHZ-BookOfAbstracts.pdf)).
